# Seltzer

A lightweight scss framework for designing with modern browsers.

## Motivation

Modern browsers have evolved but css still has a world of sharp edges
and unexpected behaviors. While bootstrap gets many projects up and
running fast, others that require a crafted design have to start from
scratch.

#### Seltzer is a framework that makes it easy and fast to craft novel
designs on the web.

Seltzer focuses on:

* Helping designers create custom component systems instead of custom CSS
* Increase the predictability of CSS with modular rules, and usage
  guidelines
* Make responsive design easy
